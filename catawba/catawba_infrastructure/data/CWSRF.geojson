the California Street Pump Station, (3) upgrades to the Town of Belhavens Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), and (4) rehabilitation of the sanitary sewer system in the Town of Belhavens waterfront area.   \n\nThe force main bypass component consists of approximately 400 linear feet of 12-inch forcemain, 11,260 linear feet of 10-inch forcemain, 3,775 linear feet of 8-inch forcemain, and 2,000 linear feet of 6-inch forcemain. \n\nSecond, the upgrades to the California Street Pump Station will require a new pump station at the California Street Pump Station site, consisting of a new 625 GPM duplex pump station with control panel, on-site audible and visual alarms, a new back up generator, wet well modifications, and new security fence.\n\nThird, the headworks at the Towns WWTP will be upgraded.  This upgrade consists of rehabilitating the bar screen and grit chamber, and installing a new influent flow meter.\n\nLast, the gravity collection network near the Historic Waterfront Area and near the California Street Pump Station and U.S. Highway 264 area will be rehabilitated and replaced. This part of the project involves lining approximately 8,700 l.f. of 8-inch gravity sewer and replacing approximately 1,110 l.f. of 8-inch pipe. Rehabilitation will also include approximately 31 manhole replacements and rain inserts, 10 point repairs, and 236 service lateral tap replacements.\n","USER_Project_Needs_Categories":"Centralized
